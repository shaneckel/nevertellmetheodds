You know your way around the tool shed. You have prior experience coordinating resources and schedules for a fabrication shop, design studio or space program. You are exacting, punctual, analytical and meticulous. Having mastered the art of the Gantt chart, you can wrangle dependencies, octopuses, cats and creative types with ease. You've got exceptional organizational skills, bordering on obsession, but you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty. When you roll up, resource management is in the driver seat and quality control is riding shotgun. (It is pretty much a given that you probably designed and built your ride as well.) Inflexible deadlines are familiar to you, as are contingency plans for your contingency plans.<br />

The applicant must be proactive and solution oriented.<br />
The applicant must have the ability to communicate effectively with a multi-disciplinary project team of fabricators and designers.<br />
The applicant must possess experience and knowledge of the tools, materials, and techniques typical to wood substrate, plastic, and metal fabrication.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Bonus points:<br />
<br />
Familiarity with 3D modeling software such as fusion 360, or Rhinoceros 3D.<br />
Familiarity with CNC machines (router, mill, laser cutter, 3D printers).<br />
Hidden talents to help our team grow.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Responsibilities:<br />
<br />
Keep all aspects of fabrication on schedule and ensure deliverables are ready on time.<br />
Track all schedule changes and document them so the team stays on target.<br />
